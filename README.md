# Example repository 

The is a simple repository designed to get familiar with Git and the coding principles we use.


## To run

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/SimonFreyaldenhoven/example_template/wiki#prerequisities) for a description of all needed dependencies.

Once all dependencies are set up, simply run `main.py` under `analysis/source` from that directory. It will do all the analysis and compile a brief latex note that can be found under `/products/paper/` utilizing those results.
